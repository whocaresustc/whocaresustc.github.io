**Background:** 
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) to attempt to address [key open scientific questions on COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks). Those questions are drawn from [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/03-11-2020/standing-committee-on-emerging-infectious-diseases-and-21st-century-health-threats-virtual-meeting-1) and the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/Global_Research_Forum_FINAL_VERSION_for_web_14_feb_2020.pdf?ua=1).
